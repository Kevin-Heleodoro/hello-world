# hello-world
This is my first repository.

My name is Kevin. I am a 30 year old single father who was raised in Somerville, MA. 
I am new to programming. I aspire to become a professional programmer within the next few years. 
Once I complete my coding bootcamp, I will search for a job in the field and begin pursuing a 
bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.
